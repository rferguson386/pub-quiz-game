# Pub Quiz Game

# Intro

This project is a quiz game to meet the requirements of portfolio project number 2 in the full stack development course. I chose to make it a general knowledge pub-quiz style of game to keep it fun for the users.

Users will be asked 10 general knowledge questions, similar in difficulty level to those they might find in a typical pub quiz.

It is intended for anyone who likes playing pub quizzes and wants to test themselves against an online version of this experience.

## Credits 

- I referred to this StackOverflow thread when trying to determine where to place the link to the Javascript file to allow my website to load as quickly as possible: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/436411/where-should-i-put-script-tags-in-html-markup. Because of this thread, I chose to use the asynchronus loading attribute my srcipt elements.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
